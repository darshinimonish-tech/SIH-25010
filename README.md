## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
AgriMitra AI is a first-of-its-kind, offline-enabled, voice-first, hyperlocal smart advisory system that delivers personalized, scientific, and real-time crop guidance to small and marginal farmers in Punjab — even in low-connectivity, low-literacy rural settings.

It combines AI-powered recommendations, local language voice technology, and solar-powered offline devices to ensure that every farmer — regardless of literacy or tech access — receives tailored, trustworthy agricultural advice.


## Technical Approach
<h3>Technologies to Be Used</h3>

Frontend: React Native for cross-platform app

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI) + Node.js

AI/ML Models:

TensorFlow + YOLOv8 for pest/disease detection

NLP in Punjabi (via Whisper/OpenAI Whisper + Coqui)

Time-series forecasting for weather + market pricing

Database: PostgreSQL + Vector DB for AI memory

Offline Support: SQLite with periodic sync + local caching

Hardware:

Raspberry Pi for kiosks

Solar power bank integration

Smart lens accessory (low-cost design)

* Methodology and Implementation Process

Phase 1: Prototype & Co-Creation

Co-design with 2 pilot villages in Punjab

Collect soil, crop, and pest image datasets

Train Punjabi voice bot with dialect samples

Phase 2: Pilot Deployment

Deploy 5–10 AgriMitra Boxes

Distribute Smart Lenses to local FPOs

WhatsApp advisory launched with local agri officers

Phase 3: Scale + Feedback Loop

Use farmer feedback to evolve AI Farmer Twin

Deploy in multiple districts

Partner with KVKs, NGOs, local agri shops






  
## Feasibility and Viability
<h3>Feasibility</h3>

Works even in offline areas

Low-cost hardware (~₹4,000 per kiosk)

WhatsApp-based solution = no app installs

Voice-first = inclusive of all literacy levels

Built-in analytics to monitor success

* Potential Challenges & Mitigation
Challenge	Mitigation Strategy
Low initial trust	Partner with local NGOs, extension workers
Device damage or misuse	Community ownership model + training
AI misinterpretation of dialects	Continuous model retraining from voice data
Farmer retention	Gamified rewards & local champion farmers





  
## Impact and Benefits
<h3>Social Impact</h3>

Empowers 86% of Punjab’s small/marginal farmers

Builds scientific thinking and confidence in decision-making

Reduces dependence on local dealers’ misinformation

* Economic Benefits

20–30% yield improvement

15–25% reduction in input cost

Better market timing = improved profit margins

* Environmental Benefits

Reduced chemical misuse

Better soil & water health

Promotes sustainable crop cycles
